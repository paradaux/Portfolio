				<h2 class="question">In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
				<p class="answer">Hello and thank you for reading my page! My name is Eric Devaux and I am <span id="age"></span> old. Primarily self-taught, I am an amateur when it comes to Web Design but I am looking to change that! Currently I work as a System Administrator for a bank in Boston. I like joking around a lot, so if you find something 'funny/odd' in my code or on one of my pages, it is probably a joke. Below is an unordered list of other assorted information about me that I don't mind sharing with you.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Male</li>
					<li>Caucasian</li>
					<li>Brunette</li>
					<li>College Major: Poli. Sci. and Japanese Language.</li>
					<li>ENTP</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="question">Why are you taking this course?</h2>
				<p class="answer">While I am already experienced with Web Development when it comes to the front end, and I have forayed into back-end scripting languages like Node.JS, I feel my coding abilities could use improvement! Additonally, because I am self-taught, I am unfamiliar with many valuable tools and best practices that I hope will improve my craft. Overall, I'd like to use this course to take me from Amateur to professional and I take my education very seriously! I would also like to make friends in the class who share my interest in Web Development.</p>
				<h2 class="question">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
				<p class="answer">I have a good amount of experience with HTML/CSS/JS and Node. While I can code well, I am self-taught so sometimes I miss things due to lack of practice or formality. I've found that when learning new material, however, that my patient nature allows me to crack away at the problem until I finally experience that cathartic release that comes with resolving a problem and seeing everything work. I <i>live</i> for that!</p>
				<h2 class="question">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
				<p class="answer">Since High School I have always dual booted Windows and Ubuntu distros on my personal machine. Thus I have the versatility that comes with the compatibility of Microsoft and customizability of Linux. Currently I use Windows 7/8 and <span id="distro"></span> - I am comfortable with both, but I am a master of neither.</p>
				<h2 class="question">Anything else we should know?</h2>
				<p class="answer">I have setup a LAMP server before with Linode and I made <a href="http://www.totalprojectcontrol.com" target="_blank">this website</a> for my father (the forum is made with <a href="http://forum.totalprojectcontrol.com" target="_blank">NodeBB</a>). I have a particular interest in using technology to improve our political system.</p>
